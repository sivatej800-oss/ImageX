# Local Datasets

This directory is for datasets that you can download and place locally.

## Structure

Place your downloaded datasets in this directory. The structure should be:

```
data/local/
├── dataset1/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── test/
│   └── validation/
├── dataset2/
│   └── images/
└── ...
```

## Notes

- Large data files are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`)
- Make sure to organize your data consistently
- Refer to `DATASETS.md` in the root directory for information about available datasets
